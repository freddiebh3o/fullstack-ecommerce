# Fullstack E-commerce (Next.js + Prisma)

This is a learning-focused fullstack e-commerce application built with **Next.js 15**, **Prisma**, and **Postgres**, featuring an **admin panel** with authentication and product management.  
Media uploads are handled locally via **AWS S3 emulation** (LocalStack in Docker) to practice scalable file storage without any AWS billing risk.
We‚Äôve recently integrated **multitenancy support with RBAC permissions** so that all CRUD operations are scoped to a tenant, and users can switch between tenants securely.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project is strictly for practice. There will never be real users or a production deployment.

## üí∏ Hosting & Infrastructure Costs

This project is designed to be cloud-hosted with **Next.js (Vercel or similar), Supabase (Postgres), and S3-compatible storage**. Below is an estimate of ongoing monthly costs at different scales (excluding developer time).

### Frontend + API (Next.js)
- **Vercel Pro**: $20/user/month (covers SSR, API routes, custom domains, SSL).  
- Alternative: self-host (AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean Droplet) from $5‚Äì$20/month.  

üëâ Typical budget: **$20‚Äì$50/month**.

### Database (Supabase / Postgres)
- Supabase Free: 500MB storage, 50k requests.  
- Supabase Pro: $25/month ‚Üí 8GB storage, 8GB bandwidth.  
- Scales with storage and usage:  
  - 50GB DB ‚Üí ~$100/month.  
  - 200GB DB ‚Üí ~$400/month.  

üëâ Typical budget: **$25‚Äì$100/month initially**, scaling as tenants grow.

### Storage (S3 or Supabase Storage)
- Stores product images, logos, documents.  
- AWS S3 pricing: $0.023/GB stored, $0.09/GB egress.  
- Example:  
  - 10k images @ 500KB ‚Üí 5GB = $0.12/month.  
  - 100k images ‚Üí 50GB = $1.15/month.  
- Bandwidth (downloads by customers) is the main cost driver.  

üëâ Typical budget: **$5‚Äì$25/month** early on.

### Authentication & Emails
- NextAuth itself is free.  
- OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.): free.  
- Email delivery (Postmark, SendGrid, etc.): $15‚Äì$50/month depending on volume.  

üëâ Typical budget: **$0‚Äì$30/month**.

###  Database Backups & Snapshots (Supabase)

#### Daily Backups (included)
- **Pro Plan**: 1 daily backup retained for 7 days.
- **Team Plan**: Retained for 14 days.
- **Enterprise Plan**: Retained up to 30 days.
- No extra cost‚Äîpart of the base plan.  
  *(Source: Supabase docs)*

#### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) ‚Äì Optional Add-on
- Restores to any point in time (second-level precision).
- **Replaces** daily backups while active.
- Billed hourly for the duration enabled:
  - **7-day retention**: ~$100/month  
  - **14-day retention**: ~$200/month  
  - **28-day retention**: ~$400/month  
  *(Example based on full activation for 744-hour month)*

#### Summary Table

| Backup Type                | Included Cost    | Coverage                   | Add-on Cost                        |
|----------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Daily Automated Backups    |                  | 7/14/30-day retention      | None (in plan)                     |
| PITR Add-on (enabled only) |                  | Second-level granularity   | $100‚Äì$400/month based on retention |

## üí∞ Total Hosting Cost Overview (Medium‚ÄìLarge Usage)

This section summarizes the expected monthly costs of running this project in production with **Supabase (DB/Auth/Storage)** and **Vercel/Next.js (frontend)**.

### Core Services

| Service          | Plan / Tier            | Est. Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Supabase Database** | Pro Plan (8GB Postgres, 500K monthly edge function calls, 100GB storage) | $25‚Äì$50 | Base subscription |
| **Supabase Storage**  | Included in Pro (100GB) | Extra: $0.02/GB beyond quota | Product images, documents, tenant assets |
| **Supabase Auth**     | Included in Pro | First 50k MAUs free, then $0.0035/user | Multi-tenant logins |
| **Supabase Edge Functions** | Included in Pro | Extra usage billed per request | For custom API logic |
| **Vercel Hosting**    | Pro Team Plan | $20/user (devs) + bandwidth charges | Covers Next.js SSR/ISR builds, CDN, domains |

### Backup & Recovery

| Backup Type            | Retention | Cost             | Notes |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| **Daily Backups**      | 7 days    | Included         | Automatic, no charge |
| **PITR (optional)**    | 7‚Äì28 days | $100‚Äì$400/month  | Precise recovery; billed hourly while enabled |

### Estimated Totals

- **Base (no PITR):**  
  ~$50‚Äì$100/month  
  (Supabase Pro + Vercel Pro + light storage overages)

- **With PITR enabled:**  
  ~$150‚Äì$500/month  
  (depending on retention period and storage growth)

- **Growth scaling factors:**  
  - +$0.02/GB storage per tenant (images, docs, backups)  
  - +$0.0035/authenticated user beyond 50k monthly users  
  - +Vercel bandwidth (first TB free, then ~$40/TB)  

### Notes

- Costs scale with **number of tenants**, **data stored**, and **traffic**.  
- For **enterprise use**, expect higher storage + PITR to be mandatory ‚Üí ~$500‚Äì$800/month.  
- For **startup/small biz**, base Pro tiers on Supabase + Vercel will suffice (<$100/month).  


## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install

```
### 2. Environment variables
Create a .env file in the project root:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/dbname"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-random-secret"

# LocalStack S3 emulation
S3_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4566"
S3_BUCKET="ecom-dev-bucket"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 3. Prisma setup
Generate the Prisma client and set up the database

```
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Run localStack (S3 emulator)
```
docker compose up -d
```

### 5. LocalStack S3 Setup
LocalStack emulates AWS services locally. We use it here to emulate S3 for file uploads

After starting LocalStack with docker:
```
docker compuse up -d
```
You'll need to create the development bucket once inside the container:
```
# Open a shell inside the LocalStack container
docker exec -it localstack bash

#create the bucket 
awslocal s3 mb s3://ecom-dev-bucket
```

That's it -- the bucket ecom-dev-bucket will now be available at:
```
http://s3.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/ecom-dev-bucket
```

### 5. Run the Development server
```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

### 6. Admin login
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: Admin123!
- Login at http://localhost:3000/login

### 7. Useful scripts
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Reset DB (drops all data, re-applies migrations, re-seeds)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Inspect/edit data in a UI
npx prisma studio
```

## üîë Recap of Recent Integration

- **Multitenancy foundations**  
  - Added `Tenant`, `Membership`, `Role`, `Permission`, and `PermissionAssignment` models.  
  - All `Product`, `Category`, `Brand`, `Image` entities are now tenant-scoped.  
  - Global users (`User`) can belong to multiple tenants through `Membership`.  

- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**  
  - Each tenant has seeded roles: `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `EDITOR`, `READONLY`.  
  - Roles map to fine-grained permissions (`product.read`, `product.write`, `brand.read`, `brand.write`, etc).  
  - Safeguards prevent deleting/demoting the last OWNER of a tenant.  

- **Superadmin / Admin distinction**  
  - Global `SUPERADMIN`: can see/switch into all tenants.  
  - Global `ADMIN`: can create tenants and manage memberships, but only sees tenants they belong to.  
  - Global `USER`: needs membership in a tenant to access its admin UI.  

- **Tenant switcher**  
  - Users can switch tenants via a dropdown (`tenant-switcher.tsx`).  
  - Switching sets a signed cookie `x-current-tenant-id`, which server routes use to scope queries.  

- **Scoped CRUD**  
  - All `/api/admin/*` routes now resolve tenant context through a helper (`getApiTenantCtx` / `getCurrentTenantId`).  
  - Create/read/update/delete operations are fully tenant-isolated.  
  - Slug uniqueness is enforced per-tenant, not globally.  

- **Categories & Brands tenant integration**  
  - Categories and Brands now fully respect tenant scoping and permissions.  
  - API routes guarded with `withTenantPermission` / `withAnyTenantPermission`.  
  - Server pages guarded with `ensurePagePermission` / `ensureAnyPagePermission`.  
  - Client-side actions gated via `PermissionGate` using `canWriteCategory` / `canWriteBrand`.  
  - Audit logs capture create/update/delete actions with `{ tenantId, userId }`.  

- **Seed data**  
  - Two tenants (`default`, `acme`) are created with roles, memberships, categories, brands, and products.  
  - Multiple demo users are seeded with different roles per tenant for testing.  

---

### üöß Still to Do (Tenant Integration)
- **Dashboard** ‚Üí ensure metrics/data are scoped by current tenant.  
- **Products** ‚Üí apply the same tenant + permission guards as Categories/Brands.  
- **Members** ‚Üí tenant-specific CRUD with role assignment + safeguards.  
- **Users tab** ‚Üí restricted to Admin/Superadmin only (global view across tenants). Normal tenant users will never see this option.

### API hardening
- [ ] All routes scoped to `{ tenantId }`.  
- [ ] Cross-tenant ID operations ‚Üí 404.  
- [ ] Invalid body ‚Üí 400 with Zod error.  

### Auth/session
- [ ] Switch tenant does not log out.  
- [ ] Removing cookie falls back to first membership or ‚ÄúNo tenant selected‚Äù.  

### Check for files no longer used and remove them
